## Psychopomp Gold by Tsu

This repository contains all the mods I've created for *Psychopomp Gold*, complete with their source code.

### Available Mods

- [Freecam Mod](https://github.com/trevorftp/Psychopomp/tree/main/Freecam) - A mod that enables free camera movement, allowing players to explore levels freely without constraints.
- [QuickBoot](https://github.com/trevorftp/Psychopomp/tree/main/QuickBoot) = Allows you to boot the game faster for mod testing, skips the game warning, and gear scenes and loads the game straight to the mods menu. The mod creates an editable .ini inside of your %appdata% -> Psychopomp folder which allows you to edit the scene the game boots to.


### The 'Extended' Modding SDK!

- [Collision Message Dialogues](https://github.com/trevorftp/Psychopomp/tree/main/Extended%20SDK/MessageTrigger) - A script and prefab that allow you to drag and drop message triggers into your scene that well, trigger dialogue!
- [Custom World Map](https://github.com/trevorftp/Psychopomp/tree/main/Extended%20SDK/CustomWorldMap) - A custom world map.
